    <h2>What is CI/CD?</h2>
    <p>
      CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.
      Continuous Integration means every change is frequently merged and automatically checked.
      This helps detect errors early and keeps the codebase stable.
      Continuous Delivery/Deployment means the latest successful version is released automatically.
      In cloud systems, CI/CD speeds up updates and reduces manual work and human mistakes.

    <h2>My Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
      After I push to the main branch, GitHub Actions runs automatically.
      It checks that my required files exist, then packages the website and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
      Finally, my live website updates with the newest changes.
