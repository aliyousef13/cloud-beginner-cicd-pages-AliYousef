        <h2>What is CI/CD?</h2>
        <p>
          CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
          Continuous Integration means every code change is pushed and checked automatically.
          This helps detect problems early and keeps the project organized.
          Continuous Deployment means the latest successful version is published automatically.
          In cloud systems, CI/CD reduces manual work and makes delivery faster and more reliable.

        <h2>My Pipeline</h2>
        <p>
          When I push my code to the main branch, GitHub Actions starts automatically.
          First, it checks that the required files exist.
          Then it prepares the website files and deploys them to GitHub Pages.
          Finally, the live website is updated with the latest successful version.
