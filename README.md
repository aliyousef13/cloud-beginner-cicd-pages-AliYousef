# Cloud CI/CD Beginner Assignment

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

## How CI/CD Works in This Project
Every time I push code to the main branch:
1. GitHub Actions runs automatically.
2. It checks that required files exist.
3. It packages the website.
4. It deploys the site to GitHub Pages.

This demonstrates Continuous Integration (automatic checks) and Continuous Deployment (automatic publishing).
